# VMM USER Flag Issue - Troubleshooting and Fix

## Problem Description

The `vmm_map_page_secure` function was correctly adding the USER flag to page table entries for user space addresses, but the test "Secure user mapping" was failing. The issue was that user pages were being reported as "NOT user accessible" even though the USER flag was being set.

## Root Cause Analysis

The problem was in the page directory entry creation. When the VMM creates a new page table, it only sets `PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE` flags on the page directory entry, without including the `PAGE_USER` flag.

The `vmm_is_user_accessible` function correctly checks BOTH:
1. The page directory entry for the USER flag
2. The page table entry for the USER flag

Since the page directory entry was missing the USER flag, even though individual pages had it, the accessibility check would fail.

## Original Issue Location

In `vmm.c`, the `get_page_table` function:
```c
/* Set the page directory entry */
page_dir->entries[dir_index] = phys_addr | PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE;
// Missing PAGE_USER flag for user pages!
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `vmm_user.c` with Enhanced Functions

- **`get_page_table_secure()`**: Creates page tables with proper permissions, including USER flag for user pages
- **`vmm_map_page_with_secure_table()`**: Uses the secure page table creation function

### 2. Updated `vmm_map_page_secure()`

Modified to use `vmm_map_page_with_secure_table()` instead of the original `vmm_map_page()`, ensuring that:
- Page directory entries get the USER flag when mapping user pages
- Page table entries also get the USER flag (as before)

### 3. Key Fix

The critical change is in page table creation:
```c
/* Set the page directory entry with appropriate flags */
uint32_t dir_flags = PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE;

/* If this is for a user page, add USER flag to directory entry */
if (flags & PAGE_USER) {
    dir_flags |= PAGE_USER;
}

page_dir->entries[dir_index] = phys_addr | dir_flags;
```

## Testing

Created `test_vmm_user_flag.c` to verify:
1. User pages mapped without explicit USER flag get it automatically
2. Page directory entries have the USER flag set
3. Page table entries have the USER flag set
4. `vmm_is_user_accessible()` returns true for user pages

## Files Modified/Created

1. **Created**: `src/kernel/memory/vmm_user.c` - Enhanced VMM functions
2. **Modified**: `src/kernel/memory/vmm_protection.c` - Updated to use secure functions
3. **Created**: `src/tests/test_vmm_user_flag.c` - Specific test for this issue
4. **Modified**: `src/tests/test_memory_isolation.c` - Integrated new test

## Result

The fix ensures that when mapping user space pages:
- Both page directory and page table entries have appropriate USER flags
- User space pages are correctly identified as user-accessible
- Security isolation is maintained while allowing proper user page access

The test suite now properly validates that user pages are accessible from user mode while kernel pages remain protected.
